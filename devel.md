# Team Firework Dev Information for Vista Style
Look at the Unfinished Features list at the bottom of the main page (aka README). Try and solve these problems while keeping the main script short, and check the Wiki's Proposed Features page and use the ones at the top marked "Coming Soon" and add those.
# Wiki Dev Information
The Wiki on GitHub needs work. Add Proposed Features, Feature List, and Developer Information after the main page.
# Web Developers
This page is for internal development on the Vista Style setup. Please use the GitHub Wiki's Developer Information page for information on how you can add Vista to your website.
