# VistaStyle
A webpage style setup and design known as Vista.

Vista is a design standard based on circles, wisps, curves, and "cool colors".
This page itself could be an example of a Vista design page. Web developers: use a script found in the wiki's Developers page to introduce the Vista Style Script into your webpage, which automatically inserts everything it needs based on a getElementById operation.

## Advantages for using Vista

- Lock screens, landing pages, and ad intermissions available
- Seperate error tracking system used with different syntax errors, etc. to further enhance development

## Advantages for using Vista-powered websites
